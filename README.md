# Anitra Conover Portfolio
As a Geographic Information Science (GIS) professional, I use maps to observe trends and inform decisions. Extreme weather is increasingly threatening the U.S. food system, and I am passionate about leveraging spatial data to help farms build resilience and adapt to emerging risks. 

My work in the food and agriculture sector has spanned across roles in academia, city government, and non-government organizations. In both technical roles and policy roles, I have led grant writing, program evaluation, facilitation, mediation, as well as project management.

# About

My work in the food and agriculture sector is what eventually led me to GIS and spatial data analysis. I started my career working in food security and eventually chose to focus on resilient agriculture because of its key role in the long-term fight against hunger. After working in federal ag policy for several years, spatial data's crucial role in risk assessment and resilience-building became clear.

I am currently pursuing a Master's of GIS at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Within GIS, I am particularly interested in spatio-temporal modelling, data manipulation, spatial data standards/infrastructure, spatial statistics, remote sensing, and spatial data uncertainty. Using my GIS skillsets, I hope to answer two questions essential to scaling profitable, resilient agriculture:

🌱 How can earth observation and remote sensing better evaluate agricultural risk and therefore improve farm finance tools for resilient agricultural practices?

🌱 How can revisions to existing spatial data infrastructure better support profitable, disaster-resilient agriculture?
