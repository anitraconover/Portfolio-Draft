# About
As a Geographic Information Science (GIS) professional, I use maps to observe trends and inform decisions. Increasingy extreme weather events are altering the landscape of U.S. agriculture, and I am passionate about leveraging spatial data to build resilience so that farms can adapt to emerging risks. 

My work in the food and agriculture sector has spanned across roles in academia, city government, and non-government organizations. In both technical roles and policy roles, I have led grant writing, program evaluation, facilitation, mediation, and other project management responsibilities.
